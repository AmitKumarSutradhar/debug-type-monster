                <h2>Session Storage vs. Local Storage: What Are the Differences?</h2>
                <p>Both local and session storages are key-value stores, meaning that they both store data in a dictionary format. The
                value of each key has to be a string, so if we have complex data structures like objects or arrays, we need to
                serialize them using JSON strings.</p>
