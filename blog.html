                    <h2>Session Storage vs. Local Storage: What Are the Differences?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Both local and session storages are key-value stores, meaning that they both store data in a dictionary format. The
                    value of each key has to be a string, so if we have complex data structures like objects or arrays, we need to serialize them using JSON strings.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Block Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the
                    outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the
                    variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Global Scope: Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed
                    from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

                    <hr>
                    <p>JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.</p>
                    <p><b>Call stack:</b> The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is
                    finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>
                    <p><b>The event queue: </b>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data
                    structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.</p>
                    <p>Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the
                    command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.</p>
